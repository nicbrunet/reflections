1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It's a little hard to see at first, because the + and - is something I'll have to wrap my mind around.
I'm sure I'll get a handle on the fact the - points out what was removed from the original file.
And then + points to things that have been added to the new file.
So it's not saying, hey this has changed, but rather this was removed and this was added.
Same thing in the big picture, just a different way of saying the same thing.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Having access to all older versions of a file allows you to make changes and be confident that you can restore to a previous backup if you screw up.
This allows you to play with your code without worrying that you'll never be able to get back to an old, working version if you break it.
Having this assurance allows programmers to be more creative and to learn by doing.
