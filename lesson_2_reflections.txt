2.1 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository a .git file is created.
Tis is needed to track all the commits and histories of each file you add to the repository.
Without a .git file you would just have a directory full of untracked files.

2.2 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like a temporary holding area where you can put files you will be adding to a commit.
The value of this is that you can specify one (or more) files from a directory for a commit.
It also allows you to NOT add every single file in the directory to a commit at once.
