3.1 When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Creating a remote repository alls access to it by other people, say for a collaborative project.
Additionally, a remote repository serves as a cloud-stored backup of your local files.

3.2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want to manually pull changes from GitHub because there could be someone working remotely on the files and you wouldn't want to pull incomplete files.
Also, you may not want to pull every branch and instead specify on one particular branch you want to work on from GitHub, so pulling all of them is inefficient.
Overall allowing Git to decide when and what to pull would be much less efficient than manually deciding what to pull and when.
